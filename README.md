noise is a simple project where I explored a visualization of what 
a biome map looks like. It was made in recent times and is a small
side project I work on for fun. The goal is to get a better understanding
of how games can generate a world with many biomes. I also made
it so you can watch it flow and change overtime in a nice animation
which I plan to use as a background when I make my own website.

too many bosses is an old project I made in freshman year of college.
I had originally intended to add many more bosses but I never got
back to the project so the name doesn't make too much sense as there
is only one boss. It is a simple boss fight, controls are wasd space
and j to attack as well as double press down to drop through a platform.
At the time I was trying to teach a friend how some of the code works
to get them interested in the making games in Java so some sections
are heavily commented, I opted not to remove these or change the code
much since it's a good representation of who I used to be and can be
a good benchmark for how much I've grown.
