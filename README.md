Noise is a project where I explored a visualization of what 
a biome map looks like. It was made in recent times and is a small
side project I work on for fun. The goal is to get a better understanding
of how games can generate a world with many biomes. I also made
it so you can optionally watch it flow and change overtime in a nice 
animation though it doesn't make much sense in the context of generating 
a world but it does look pretty cool.

Simulated world is a large project where I explore simulating life and 
creating behaviors for creatures to fulfill their needs like hunger and 
thirst. The first goal was to make the creatures smart enough to 
actually take care of themselves without dying. After completing that I
worked on making them reproduce as well as have some downtime instead
of constantly working to consume and reproduce as fast as possible like
some kind of disease destroying all the land. I then added a predator 
and worked fear into the creatures so they would run. The last thing I
did was some work in making it easier to add future creatures so the
only thing I have to do is fill in some variables and all creatures
can use the same code with different parameters.
